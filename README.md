# Stroke-Prediction
- Objective: Build a Random Forest Classifier and a Light Gradient Boosting Model in an effort to predict which patients will experience a stroke.
- Dataset: Patient data taken from Kaggle site that is made up of more than 5,000 entries. Predicting a boolean value - stroke occurred or not.
- Approach: Load in raw dataset, conduct EDA, data cleaning/preprocessing, RF classifier, Light GBM, generate model predictions, and evaluate performance.
- Key Findings: The Random Forest classifier was not performing very well, so I decided to pivot to a Light GBM classifier, which produced better results. Due to the class imbalance of the dataset, I determined that the model's overall accuracy was not an indicative metric of how to evaluate its performance. I attempted to combat this under-representation of Class 1 (stroke occurrence) in the dataset, but this still proved to be a hurdle in model building. Of all the predictions the final LGBM labeled as a stroke, only 14% were actually stroke cases.
